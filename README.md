# Face Generation using Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN)

## What's in it
This repository is related to the Artificial Intelligence Course of DHBW Mannheim. It tries to generate faces using an Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN).
The project uses the common dataset [CelebA](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/celeba-dataset) which consists of more than 200k images of celebrities to generate fake faces. Therefore an typical architecture of a GAN neural network will be created and trained on this dataset.
A short introduction to GAN Neural Networks is provided below.


### Generative Adversarial Networks (GANS)
Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) are types of artificial neural networks consisting of two main components: a generator and a discriminator network.
The main problem GANs address is the generation of realistic data that follows a specific target distribution like images, text or audio.
The operation of a GAN is characterised by adversarial training in wich the generator and the discriminator are in competition. The generator first generates random data that should follow a specific distribution, e.g. images of faces.
The discriminator then attempts to distinguish between the real data and the data generated by the generator network. During the training process, both the generator and the discriminator continuously adapt to outperform each other.
The generator learns to produce data that is increasingly similar to the real data, while the discriminator learns to distringuish between real and generated data.
This enables GAN network to generate realistic.

### Frechet Inception Distance
To evaluate the GANs performance this notebook uses the Frechet Inception Distance (FID). It's a metric to measure the similarity between the generated and real distribution of the images based on the activation weights of a pretrained network.
An low FID-value indicates a high similarity between the generated and the real images.


## Requirements
Follow these steps befor running the notebook

- [ ] python 3.9 or newer installed
- [ ] packages listed in the [requirements.txt]() file are installed
- [ ] CelebA-Dataset

> **note:** the trainings process is much faster when using cuda, so maybe setup and install pytorch with cuda (or *mps* on mMacs)
